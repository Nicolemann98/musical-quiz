## Features

*Navigation

    * The site is simple to navigate, with the questions refreshing after the user has inputted the correct (or incorrect) answer and clicked on the OK button to move onto the next
    * There is a counter to keep track of the number of correct and incorrect answers provided
    * The layout of the navigation is fairly simple and should be easy for users to use
    * The font contrasts the background colour so is easy to read
    * In order to start again, the user simply needs to refresh the page

*The Header
    This section is kept simple as the quiz is interactive, in order to not complicate the code
    The head of the HTML code contains the basic instructions and meta tags 

*The question section
    This was fairly difficult to build due to the number of questions required, each had to be targeted by the JavaScript in order for the user to be able to move on to the next question
*The Footer section

    
## Testing

*I confirmed that the site works within the IDE and when deployed onto the browser

*I confirmed that the page is repsonsive and functions on different screen sizes using DevTools device bar

*I checked that the text is readable across all pages, and that is would be easy for users to understand

*I have confirmed that the quiz works on each question by inputting the correct and an incorrect answer into each question
